# Web Scraping with Python

These are the materials for a workshop on web scraping using Python. They were made using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/), and are intended to be used as a reference during the live workshop that I teach, after the workshop for future reference, or at your own pace if you just happen upon this collection.
