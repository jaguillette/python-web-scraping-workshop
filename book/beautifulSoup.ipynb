    "Getting familiar with regular expressions takes time, but there are a few things to know that will help you get started:\n",
    "- Each text character is an instruction of some kind. For most text characters, that instruction is just \"match this one letter exactly\", but it's still an instruction. Special characters carry special instructions.\n",
    "- The \"dot\", `.`, matches any character.\n",
    "- \"Quantifiers\" change how many of the previous thing can be matched. The quantifiers are:\n",
    "    - `+` matches the thing before it one or more times, so whatever is before it still has to be there, but may occur many times.\n",
    "    - `*` matches the thing before it zero or more times, so whatever is before it is optional\n",
    "- If you want to actually match a character that normally has an instruction associated, you can \"escape\" it with `\\`. If you want to literally match a period, you can use `\\.`\n",
    "- You can extract just part of an expression by enclosing it with `()`. This allows you to use some text around the thing that you're interested in to find it, but not keep that extra cruft in the data that you extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're just scratching the surface of regular expressions, but that should be enough to let you know what's happening in the regular expression we'll use. You can take a closer look at [regex101](https://regex101.com/r/SNA9xe/1), where I've set up the expression along with the HTML of our first list item, so that you can take a look at how it works. You can also check out the quick reference in the bottom of regex101, which has a much more thorough overview of things you can do.\n",
