    "Sometimes, you'll encounter a page that loads content after the initial page load. You might get a very small HTML file from requests that doesn't contain everything on the page. This happens when a page is relying on JavaScript to load its contents, and can be difficult to deal with when scraping. One such site is the WHO photo archive. We're going to take a look at scraping a [collection of photos of WHO staff](https://photos.hq.who.int/galleries/172/who-staff-in-office) to show how you might approach scraping such a site.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Selenium to get around this page load issue. Selenium was built as a front-end testing tool, allowing developers to automatically make sure that their applications still work as they change them. This functionality translates well to web scraping, since it creates an actual web browser window controlled by Python. That will let our scripts take advantage of the browser's ability to use JS content, and will let us scrape anything that we can see when we're browsing a site as a normal user.\n",
